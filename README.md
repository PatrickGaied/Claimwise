# Claimwise - AI-Powered Insurance Claims Processing

## 1. Project Description

**Claimwise** is an intelligent insurance claims processing system that revolutionizes how insurance companies handle claim documents. Our AI-powered platform automatically extracts key information from claim documents, validates them against policy rules, and provides instant approve/deny/review decisions with detailed explanations. Built with a modern FastAPI backend and intuitive Streamlit frontend, Claimwise transforms hours of manual claim review into seconds of automated analysis.

## 2. Inspiration

The insurance industry processes millions of claims annually, with adjusters spending countless hours manually reviewing documents, cross-referencing policies, and making coverage decisions. This manual process is slow, expensive, and prone to human error. I was inspired by the potential to leverage modern AI to automate this workflow while maintaining the nuanced decision-making that insurance requires. My goal was to create a system that doesn't just extract data, but actually thinks like an experienced claims adjuster.

## 3. What it does

Claimwise accepts uploaded claim documents (PDF or text) and performs comprehensive automated analysis:

- **Smart Document Processing**: Uses OCR and PDF parsing to extract text from any document format
- **Hybrid Data Extraction**: Combines regex pattern matching with AI-powered analysis to extract structured data (customer names, policy numbers, incident dates, damage descriptions, costs)
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Applies both deterministic policy rules and AI reasoning to make coverage decisions
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides specific, contextual explanations referencing actual claim details, dollar amounts, and policy provisions
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates downloadable markdown reports with complete analysis and recommendations
- **Real-time Processing**: Delivers results in seconds through an intuitive web interface

## 4. How it was built

**Backend Architecture (FastAPI)**:
- **Document Processing**: `ocr.py` handles PDF text extraction with OCR fallback using `pdfplumber` and `pytesseract`
- **Data Extraction**: `parser.py` uses dual-stage extraction (regex + AI) to structure unstructured claim text
- **Decision Engine**: `judge.py` implements hybrid rule-based and AI-powered judgment system
- **AI Integration**: `llm_client.py` provides robust API integration with Groq and Cerebras, including fallback mechanisms
- **Data Pipeline**: `cleaner.py` and `reporter.py` handle normalization and report generation

**Frontend (Streamlit)**:
- Clean, responsive web interface for file uploads and result visualization
- Real-time processing feedback and comprehensive result display

**AI Integration**:
- Leveraged Groq's `llama-3.1-8b-instant` and Cerebras `llama3.1-8b` models
- Engineered detailed prompts for context-aware analysis and decision-making
- Implemented robust error handling and API fallback systems

## 5. Challenges I ran into

- **API Reliability**: Initially faced issues with deprecated AI models and API quota limitations, requiring implementation of robust fallback systems and model updates
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting prompts that generate specific, detailed analysis rather than generic responses required multiple iterations and careful instruction design
- **Data Extraction Accuracy**: Balancing speed and accuracy in extracting structured data from unstructured claim documents led us to implement a hybrid regex + AI approach
- **Error Handling**: Building resilient systems that gracefully handle PDF parsing failures, API timeouts, and malformed data
- **Real-time Processing**: Ensuring the system provides fast responses while performing complex AI analysis

## 6. Accomplishments I'm proud of

- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Built a fully functional, modular system with proper separation of concerns and robust error handling
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Successfully combined rule-based deterministic checks with AI reasoning for more reliable decisions
- **Real AI Integration**: Implemented actual AI inference (not mock responses) with multiple provider fallbacks for reliability
- **Professional Output**: Created a system that generates detailed, specific analysis comparable to experienced human adjusters
- **User Experience**: Developed an intuitive interface that makes complex insurance processing accessible to non-technical users
- **Scalable Design**: Architected the system with modularity and extensibility in mind for future enhancements

## 7. What I learned

- **AI Prompt Design**: Discovered the importance of specific, detailed prompts with clear output formats to get consistent, high-quality AI responses
- **Fallback Systems**: Learned the critical value of implementing multiple fallback mechanisms for both AI APIs and data extraction methods
- **Insurance Domain**: Gained deep insights into insurance claim processing workflows and the complexity of coverage decisions
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Enhanced my skills in connecting AI services with web frameworks and creating seamless user experiences
- **Error Resilience**: Understood the importance of graceful error handling in AI-powered applications where external services can fail

## 8. What's next for Claimwise

**Immediate Enhancements**:
- **Database Integration**: Replace JSON policy storage with proper database for scalable policy management
- **Advanced OCR**: Implement more sophisticated document parsing for complex claim forms and handwritten documents
- **Fraud Detection**: Add specialized AI models trained on fraud patterns and suspicious claim indicators

**Medium-term Goals**:
- **Multi-language Support**: Expand to process claims in multiple languages for international insurance companies
- **Integration APIs**: Build connectors for popular insurance management systems (Guidewire, Duck Creek, etc.)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add dashboards for claim trends, processing metrics, and adjuster performance insights

**Long-term Vision**:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Implement features for different regional insurance regulations and compliance requirements
- **Mobile App**: Develop mobile applications for field adjusters and customers to submit claims directly
- **Blockchain Integration**: Explore immutable claim records and smart contract automation for certain claim types
